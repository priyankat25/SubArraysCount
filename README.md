# Count the Number of Subarrays Meeting a Criterion:

Consider a scenario where a chocolate bar is represented by an array of integers. Each integer represents the sweetness of a piece of chocolate. Your task is to write a Java program that counts the number of contiguous subarrays (subsegments) whose sum equals a given integer.

Write a program that takes the following input:
The number of squares in the chocolate bar (n),
The sweetness of each square in the chocolate bar (squares_0, squares_1, ..., squares_{n-1}\)),
An integer representing the total sweetness to achieve (d),
An integer representing the desired number of squares in a subarray (m).
The program should output the number of subarrays satisfying the conditions.
Example:
Input:  5
        1  2  1  3  2
        3  2
Output: 2

Input:  5
        1 1 1 1 1
        3  2
Output: 0
